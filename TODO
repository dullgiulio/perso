TODO

* Issue a 404 when the index doesn't exist
* Always redirect to canonical URLs
* Better mail parsing library (can accept more non-compliant headers)
* Should show real recipient in "From " line. How to get that? Maybe mailbox name, user setting
* Can extract and download attachments and parts of multpart messages
* Can dump list of indexed values from the cache (ex: all To recipients)
* Multiple mailboxes (breaks current URLs schema)
